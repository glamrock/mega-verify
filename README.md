This is either going to be hilarious, or...

Browser addon to check integrity of files purported to be from Mega.

Since the SSL cert isn't baked into google chrome, users are open to several possible MITM attacks. This is by no means foolproof, but is a step in the right direction for the "unsinkable" Mega.

Special thanks to Nadim Kobeissi and everyone on Twitter who reported holes in Mega's security.
